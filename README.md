============

Exception Handling:
In Assignment 2, we already put in exceptions in all of our ADTs, for if someone tried to assigned an out-of-bounds value to them.  In addition to those exceptions, we added a little bit more exception handling to the rep layer, to warn the user of incorrect input instead of failing silently.
